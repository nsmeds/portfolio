                <p>
                    I'm a software developer based in Portland, Oregon, with a music industry background and a focus on building scalable, responsive web and mobile applications with modern JavaScript and RESTful APIs. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently working as a freelance contractor, developing and updating intuitive user interfaces for retail clients with React, Webpack and associated tools. I'm interested in finding a full-time position with a team creating exciting, meaningful work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My software experience includes work with React, Angular, Node, Express, MongoDB, CSS3/SCSS, HTML5, jQuery, Git, Webpack, Grunt, Gulp, Vagrant, Wordpress and the UNIX shell. I enjoy diving into legacy codebases in other languages as well, and I am always looking to expand my skillset.
